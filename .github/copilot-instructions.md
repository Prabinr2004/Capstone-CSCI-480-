# Capstone Project (CSCI-480) - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Status
This is a fresh capstone project repository. This document will be updated as the project develops.

## Getting Started
1. Review the project structure as it grows
2. Understand the problem statement and requirements
3. Identify the tech stack and dependencies
4. Set up the development environment

## Architecture Overview
*To be documented once the main components are defined*

This section should document:
- Major components and their responsibilities
- Data flow between components
- Key service boundaries
- Integration points with external systems

## Development Workflow
*To be populated based on project setup*

Key areas to document:
- How to build and run the project
- Test execution and test structure
- Debugging approaches
- Common development tasks

## Project Conventions
*To be established as development proceeds*

Areas to cover:
- Naming conventions for files and functions
- Code organization patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Configuration management
- Logging standards

## Key Files and Directories
*Structure to be defined*

```
/
├── README.md           (Project overview)
├── .github/            (GitHub-specific files)
└── (Add project structure here)
```

## External Dependencies
*To be documented as dependencies are added*

## Implementation Patterns
*To be documented with examples from the codebase*

Include:
- Common architectural patterns used
- Reusable components
- Testing patterns
- Data handling patterns

## Notes for AI Agents
- When adding features, check existing patterns in the codebase before implementing
- Update this guide when establishing new architectural decisions or conventions
- Reference specific files when patterns are complex or non-obvious
